EnsemBic: An Effective Ensemble of Biclustering to Identify Potential Biomarkers of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

To execute EnsemBic algorithm, two input files are required, viz. "Total_Biclusters.csv" and "p-value.csv". "Total_Biclusters.csv" file is generetaed using BiclustGUI platform and "p-value.csv" is generated using FuncAssociate tool. Details parameter settings of these two platform are provided in the manuscript "EnsemBic: An Effective Ensemble of Biclustering to Identify Potential Biomarkers of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma"
