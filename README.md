EnsemBic: An Effective Ensemble of Biclustering to Identify Potential Biomarkers of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

The EnsemBic algorithm is a sophisticated ensemble approach designed to integrate a high-quality collection of biclusters derived from diverse biclustering algorithms. To initiate the EnsemBic algorithm, users need two essential input files: "Total_Biclusters.csv" and "p-value.csv". The "Total_Biclusters.csv" is generated through the BiclustGUI platform, while the "p-value.csv" is produced using the FuncAssociate tool. The specific parameter configurations for both platforms are meticulously detailed in the manuscript titled "EnsemBic: An Effective Ensemble of Biclustering to Identify Potential Biomarkers of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma."
